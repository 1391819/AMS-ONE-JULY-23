# multiline map

- poem: |
  Whose girl is that? I think I know.
  Its owner is quite happy though.
  Full of joy like a vivid rainbow,
  I watch him laugh. I cry hello.
- poem: |
  He gives his girl a shake,
  And laughs until her belly aches.
  The only other sound's the break,
  Of distant waves and birds awake.
