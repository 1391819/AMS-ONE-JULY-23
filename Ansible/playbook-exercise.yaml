#Use the debug module to show the information from the 
#   "Copy nginx file over" task
#Get the playbook to fail on the "Copy nginx file over" 
# task if the path before and after are the same
#Get the playbook to only run "Copy nginx file over" 
#   task if the path before and after are the same (this won't work, why?)
#Make the "install nginx" task fail if the update cache time is
#    bigger than 1.
#Write a playbook that uninstalls nginx, you can test this by
#     running curl localhost and you should get a connection error.
#Once nginx is uninstalled, run the install playbook again and
#    run curl localhost. Did this work? If not, how can we make 
#    our install playbook better?
